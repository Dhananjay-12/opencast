Changed behaviour of analyze-mediapackage
-----------------------------------------

Behaviour of analyze-mediapackage has been changed with this fix. The buggy behaviour was replacing every character that doesn't match a-z or 0-9 with underscore character. This fix only adds underscore character to the already existing flavor only to remove "/" character, just like analyze-tracks does it.
